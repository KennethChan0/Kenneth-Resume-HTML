<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Kenneth and I graduated from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I 
  studied Food and Nutrition Science.</p>

<p>Maybe you wonder why I learn web development which is totally irrelevant to 
  my major. The reason is I want to challenge myself since coding is not easy 
  to learn not to mention to work. I really like the feeling to solve the 
  problems just like in secondary school that I figured out the mathamatic 
  questions. </p>

<p>Thank you for provide me oppoutunity to have the interview. 
  I know it is not easy to accept a person who don't have IT backgroud. 
  However, I will show the passion and ethusiastic to all of you I really like 
  this field and I really appreciate if you offer me chance to enter your 
  company.</p>
